### Rules and grading of projects

- **Master students of the Neural & Behavioural class** must work on and present a programming project; the project will be graded. 
- All **other participants** must do the following in order to get credits for the course: Work on and submit a project. No assistance before submission. 
- The projects may be one of the proposals listed below or one of your own ideas. Projects based on your own ideas are very welcome! 
- Your programming job will be evaluated according to the following criteria: 

    Criterion | Weight |
    ----------|--------|
    Complexity and scope of project ('difficulty and programming effort') | 20%
    Functionality (program accomplishes job described in project description) | 30%
    Readability of code: compartmentalization, variable names, documentation (help text for function, particularly description of input & output variables, and comments throughout code) | 20%
    Efficiency (speed, usage of memory, vectorized code, preallocation, etc.) | 10%
    Versatility of code: input & output arguments and error-checking and -handling | 10%
    Presentation | 10%
    
Note that students are expected to choose a project with appropriate difficulty to their Python skills in order to receive the best grade. Do not bit more than you can chew! Simple, but well written and documented program may score as well as or even better than a sloppily written complex program.

Therefore, try to solve your selected project on your own._

### Project deadlines and presentations

To be discussed / announced.

### Guidelines for code

- If you choose to write a "traditional" program, the 'core' code must reside within a central function, plus other functions, if needed. This function may be called by a script for the presentation (see below). Please give your central function a telling name, not something like 'main.py'.
- Also if you choose a Jupyter notebook as basis for your project, your program needs to be well-organized into functions.
- The (central) function shall take input arguments and possibly produce output arguments to make the code versatile. For example, the spike threshold detector would certainly need a data array (or a data file name) and a threshold as inputs and return timestamp lists. Sanity checks of input variables must be performed and some precautionary measures against nonsense input should be taken. Try to catch common errors. 
- The purpose of the function(s) and the nature of the input and output variables must be well explained in your code (e.g. the size of variables, data type, what kind of data etc.). 
- Extensive documentation  of  the  code should  be  provided. Place comments on top of the code lines they are supposed to comment, not in the same line as the code itself, and keep your comment in the visible part of the screen by starting new lines.
- Check out again the recommendations for good (Python) coding practice as discussed in Lectures 1 and 2. Your final code should be designed to be adaptable to other similar programming tasks and it should be comprehensible by others (e.g., your instructor). 
- In terms of complexity and workload, the projects are designed for teams of a maximum of three. In the (exceptional) case of more people, you have to incorporate a few more features, which we will decide upon in individual negotiations.
- Make sure the data which your program will digest or generate during the presentation is of a manageable size so that your demo computations finish in finite time. 
- For some of the projects there is already Python code around on the internet. It goes without saying that the task is NOT to do a simple copy-and-paste job. Detecting large chunks of verbatim copies of publicly available code or of code from the previous terms students will result in failing the course.
- Make sure that you observe any copyrights when using material (e.g., data, images, resources) of others.

### Projects

Most projects come as Jupyter notebooks with the instruction on top. 

Rating of projects: The number (4 to 8) indicates programming effort, corresponding to the score for complexity and scope mentioned above; The plus signs (+ to +++) indicated difficulty of the underlying science/analysis concepts.

- Spike threshold detector and time stamp generator (6,+)
- Dijkstra algorithm (6,++)
- Reichardt motion detector (6, ++)
- Conway's game of life (7, ++)
